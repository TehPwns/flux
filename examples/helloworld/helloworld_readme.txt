This is a very basic example on how to use flux. A tween is created on one variable, and C's time functions are used for updating. Note that the tweened variable and the value (100) are not explicitly the same type. flux converts the values in the third argument to that of the second.

Additionally, lambdas can be used in place of defining functions, but for clarity they are omitted here.
